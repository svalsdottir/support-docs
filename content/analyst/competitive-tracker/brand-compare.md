### General Overview

 A review of the most relevant delivery metrics for your selected brands in Brand Compare. Learn [how to make a Brand Compare](/analyst/competitive-tracker/how-to-create-a-brand-comparison).

### Best and Worst Campaigns

**Best campaign** : The best high-volume and segmented campaigns based on their inbox placement and read rates

**Worst campaign** : The worst high-volume and segmented campaigns based on the number of recipients who could have read the campaign's messages, but didn't.

*Note: We use volume when selecting campaigns to ensure we aren't showing very low volume campaigns with 100% read (or 0% reads). We only show campaigns that have min time of 16 hours (and max 24 hours) - to avoid short run campaigns (or super long running ones as well).* 

### Campaign Counts

**Most Active Send Day** : The day of the week that the brand sends most of its campaigns
